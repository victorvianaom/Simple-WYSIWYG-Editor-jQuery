    After double click, selection range can be obtained correctly on onclick <br />
    event but when I again click on the selected text then updated selection <br />
     range should be returned by window selection but this is not happening. <br />
     Can anybody tell me if this is a bug in javascript selection or they <br />
      have made it this way. And what could be the solution to get the updated <br />
      range apart from timer.

    <script>
        window.setInterval(function() {
            //console.log(window.getSelection())
            selection = new window.Selection
            console.log(selection)
        }, 5000)
    </script>
